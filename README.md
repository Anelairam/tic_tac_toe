## Testing 

- A round of testings happened due to the entire deployment of the project mostly used tool for the testing was the browsers development tools.
- In this stage it was noticed that in the project in the beginning. However, after several trials the randomisation and customisation of the players compinations started to     mallfuction without any profound reason.
- Some intresting bugs that are not yet addressed are that during the randomisation of the cpu choices at some combinations the choices can not be hold from the object compaired to others, also the are not. This affects the main score of the game.
